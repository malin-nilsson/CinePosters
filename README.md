### What I learned
This was my first project using an API. It was intimidating but I also learned a lot of new things. One of the most important things I learned during this project was that depending on data structure, it can be a little tricky to extract the desired data from APIs. I was required to use different fetch requests to access OMDb's data. But I successfully used the API to pull a list of movie posters matching a search query.
