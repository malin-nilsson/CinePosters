### What I learned
This was my first project using an API. It was a bit intimidating but I also learned a lot of new things. One of the most important things I learned during this project was that – depending on how the data is structured – it can be a little tricky to extract desired data from APIs. I was required to use different fetch requests to access OMDb's data, but I successfully managed to pull a list of movie posters matching a search query.
